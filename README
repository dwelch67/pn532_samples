Some examples using the NXP PN532 module for reading MiFare cards (also
does NFC (smart phone)).

A ready to use board/module plus a few rfid cards can be had for a
few bucks on ebay from ASIA.  I prefer the uart mode or HSU as the docs
call it.  The card I am using is square and red there is a blue not
square rectangular one too.  The red one has dip switches you can
use to select the mode it comes switched for HSU.  You only need
the four signals GND, VCC, SDA, SCL.   I just noticed on one side
of the board it shows those the other it shows GND, VCC, TXD, RXD which
is the serial the same pin is used for MOSI/SDA/HSU_TX depending on the
comminication mode.  Likewise the same pin is used for NSS/SCL/HSU_RX.
