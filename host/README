the simple example just reads the id, as if to use as a simple badge
reader.

complex is an attempt to take advantage of other features.

./simple /dev/ttyXXXX

So cant access sectors other than zero, the four blocks within it
are all the same, can change two of them, cant change the key.  Have
a lot to figure out.  Waiting for some Mifare ultralights.

Have some ultralights.  I think they are the basic ultralight not the
C nor EVI nor nano.  dont respond to auth, get version, read sig, and
reads past 0x0F.  No surprised, messed up one by writing stuff to
all the pages.

When doing a read the address is the page number but you get four
pages of data (16 bytes).  Doing a write you write one page at a time
(four bytes).

Page 0 SSSS
Page 1 SSSS
Page 2 SILL
Page 3 OOOO
Page 4-15 user memory
S = serial
I = Internal
L = Lock bytes
O = OTP memory

Interesting, the memory map shows 9 bytes of serial number, you get 7
bytes from the InListPassiveTarget which are 7 of those 9.

The lultra.c program was for the ultralight.

Added usimple.c, perhaps the point of this whole exercise
